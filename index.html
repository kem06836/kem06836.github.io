		<h2>Welcome!</h2> <p> So, you want to learn more about American Sign Language? You have come to the right place! In this website, you will find information about the language, its history, its culture, and its values. I hope you enjoy reading about this beautiful language!</p> 
		<h3> So, What is American Sign Language (ASL)? </h3>
		<p> American Sign Language, or <abbr title="American Sign Language">ASL</abbr>, is a language Deaf Americans use 
		to communicate. It is a complete and visual language, and it includes the use of hand movements, facial expressions and posture to communicate. These hand 
		movements are called signs, and ASL signs are specific to the United States.</p> <p> Sign language is not a universal language;
		other countries and regions have different signs. For example, British Sign Language (BSL), used in Britain, has signs
		that are different from ASL signs. An important takeaway is that ASL is <b> not</b> just English with hands; it is its own 
		language, with its own grammar, syntax, and rules. </p> 
		<h3> ASL vs. English </h3>
		<p> In what way is ASL not English with hands? Lots of ways! The languages may seem similar, but as said before, ASL has 
		its own grammar, syntax, and rules. One example is the
		different uses of words in the langauges. For example, according to www.english.stackexchange.com, the word run has almost 400 meanings in English. You 
		can run to work, you can run a meeting, you can have a running nose; however, in Sign Langauge, run would not be one
		sign. Even though in English the word run can signify many meanings, in ASL all of the different meanings would be different signs. Take this sentence for example: I woke up late with a <i>runny</i> nose, and I did not have time to <i>run</i>, because I
		had to <i>run</i> to school, because I am <i>running</i> for class president and had to <i>run</i> copies of my campaign flyers. 
		The word run, or a variation of it, appears in the sentence five times. In ASL, that would be five different signs, even
		though English just uses the one word. </p>

		<h3> History of ASL </h3>
		<p> Before 1814, there was no standard language for deaf people in America, even though there were a few thousand 
		deaf people in the country. Deaf people often used home signs, meaning they created their own signs and languages;
		however, there was no standardized language, so pockets of people could not communicate. </p>
		<p> In the early 1800s, Minister Dr. Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet had a neighbor, Mason Fitch Cogswell, who had a deaf,
		9 year old daughter named Alice Cogswell. Upon realizing Alice was very intelligent, despite being deaf, Gallaudet
		wanted to teach her how to communicate. After he failed at teaching her reading and spelling, he travelled to
		Europe, where there was deaf education, and sought out a way for Alice to learn. Once there, Gallaudet met Abbe 
		Sicard, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc, who were all accomplished Deaf educators at the National Institute for 
		Deaf-Mutes (note: people no longer say Deaf-mutes). Gallaudet and Clerc travelled back to America, and helped 
		create the American School for the Deaf in 1817, in Hartford Connecticut.</p>
		<p> American Sign Language was created from the mix of signs the new students brought, as well as French signs 
		(from French Sign Language) that Gallaudet learned from Clerc. By 1863, two Deaf schools had been opened. All of this information is from: </p> <div> <a href="https://www.start-american-sign-language.com/history-of-american-sign-language_html.">www.start-american-sign-language.com </a> </div> 
		
		<h3> Deaf Culture and Values </h3>
		<p> There are many shared values and traditions between Deaf communities. Deaf Culture is not just a group of people who
		are unnable to hear, and they do not identify as that either because that is a negative perspective. Deaf Culture is more a 
		group of people who have a shared cultural experience, and have similar values.

				<td>
				Hearing people hear everything first. If a baby cries, if a car horn honks, they hear it
				first and then look for it. Deaf people see everything first, hence why eyes and sight are important in Deaf culture. Deaf
				people have great peripheral vision, and use it to see what is around them and respond to it.
				</td>
				<td>
				Although not every deaf person knows sign language, it is definitely a key part in the Deaf community, and the primary way people 
				who are a part of Deaf culture commnicate. 
				</td>
				<td>
				Though indepedence is predominant in the hearing world, collectivism is an integral value in Deaf culture. If a hearing
				person is late to class because of an accident on the highway, they may try to sneak into class without anyone noticing; 
				however, if a deaf person is late for the same reason, they're a lot more likely to pause class for a moment and explain 
				the accident. Deaf culture is heavily based upon information sharing and communication in a collective community.

		<p> <b> My take on these stats:</b> </p>
		<p> 
		As evident by the first statistic, a majority of deaf children are born to hearing parents, which is a crazy statistic! Along with that, 
		a majority of those hearing parents did not know sign language before they had their child, and a majority of the parents do not learn it
		either. Imagine if you and your parents, or you and your child, had a different first language, or no language in common. Things 
		in the household could become very difficult. As for the second statistic, that is a lot of people who could potentially need ASL to communicate! That is why I encourage anyone
		reading to learn some signs, or even strive to learn the whole language, because it is very prevelant in the US!</p>

		</div>
		<h3> Interesting Statistics </h3>
		<ol>
			<li>More than 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents.</li>
			<li>About 2 to 3 out of every 1,000 children in the United States are born with a detectable level of hearing loss in one or both ears.</li>
